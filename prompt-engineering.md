How to make pizza dough?

Making pizza dough is a relatively simple process, and you can enjoy the satisfaction of creating a delicious homemade pizza. Here's a basic pizza dough recipe:

Ingredients:

2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) of active dry yeast
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
3/4 cup warm water (around 110째F or 43째C)
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
Instructions:

Proof the yeast:

In a small bowl, combine the warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes. It should become frothy and bubbly. If it doesn't, the yeast might be inactive, and you'll need to start over with fresh yeast.
Mix dry ingredients:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
Combine wet and dry ingredients:

Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour the yeast mixture and olive oil into it.
Knead the dough:

Mix everything together until a dough forms. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment. If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour, a tablespoon at a time, until it's smooth and elastic.
Let the dough rise:

Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Allow it to rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
Preheat your oven:

If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven and preheat it to the highest temperature your oven can go (usually around 500째F or 260째C). If you don't have a pizza stone, simply preheat the oven.
Prepare your pizza:

Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any excess air. Divide it into two equal portions for two 12-inch pizzas. You can also make one large pizza or smaller individual pizzas.
Roll out the dough on a floured surface into your desired pizza shape and thickness. If you're using a pizza stone, transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper to make it easier to slide onto the hot stone.
Add your toppings:

Add your favorite pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings to the dough.
Bake the pizza:

If you're using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the parchment paper with the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven. If not using a stone, place your pizza on a baking sheet or pizza pan.
Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and browned.
Enjoy your homemade pizza!

Feel free to customize your pizza dough by adding herbs, garlic, or other seasonings to the dough for extra flavor. Enjoy your delicious homemade pizza!
